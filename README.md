An Autokey script to delete messages from Facebook Marketplace

Since Facebook doesn't provide a mechanism to bulk delete messages, I created this script that loops a number of times, using the mouse cursor to click the hover button, then "delete", then the confirm button.

Use XEV or similar to determine the cursor's position, and change the script accordingly.
